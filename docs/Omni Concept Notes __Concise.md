# **OMNI – CONCEPT NOTE**

## **1\. Vision**

Omni is building the **AI-native execution intelligence layer for engineering teams** — a system that understands real progress from actual developer activity, not manual updates.

We believe the next generation of software companies will run on **signal-driven truth**, not human-entered status reports. Omni aims to be the operating system that powers that shift — starting in India, built for the world.

## **2\. Problem**

Current project management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana) rely on a broken assumption:

**They expect engineers to manually update task status promptly, accurately, and consistently.**

Reality:

* Engineers rarely update tasks  
* PRs and commits move but tasks don’t  
* Managers don’t know what’s blocked until too late  
* Standups become status-reporting meetings  
* Leaders lack real-time visibility into execution  
* Risk and delays emerge silently

These tools reflect the **perception** of progress, not the **truth** of progress.

## **3\. Why This Problem Exists**

Engineering execution is fragmented across:

* GitHub/Gitlab: commits, PRs, reviews  
* Slack: discussions, decisions  
* CI/CD: test runs, failures  
* PM tools: tasks, timelines

All the signals are there — but no system **connects them, understands them, or acts on them**.

The gap between *work happening* and *visibility into that work* is huge.

We have lived this pain firsthand across our careers — driving our conviction to solve it.

## **4\. Solution — Omni**

Omni is an **AI-native execution intelligence system** that captures raw developer signals and transforms them into:

* Real-time progress updates  
* PR & commit intelligence  
* Risk & delay prediction, Bottleneck alerts  
* Automatic task status updates  
* Automated standups & sprint summaries  
* Team workload insights

### **Omni does 4 things:**

1. **Capture signals**  
    GitHub, Slack, CI, PR comments.

2. **Understand meaning using AI**  
    What moved, what’s stuck, why, who’s blocked, actual progress.

3. **Nudge risks and blockers automatically**  
    Stalled PRs, no commits, overdue tasks, high review load.

4. **Provide execution visibility**  
    Daily progress timeline, sprint health, PR activity, workload heatmaps.

## **6\. Why Now**

* AI can understand code, commits, tasks, conversations  
* LLMs enable semantic understanding of developer activity  
* Engineering productivity is the hottest enterprise space  
* Remote & async teams need visibility  
* Linear proved that design \+ engineering tools can be reimagined  
* Workflows today generate massive machine-readable signals

 **Omni becomes the intelligence layer that interprets all of it.**

## **7\. Market & Business Model**

**TAM:** $40B+ Developer Tools \+ PM tools \+ Productivity Software

**Wedge:** Tech startups & mid-size engineering teams (10–500 devs)

**Expansion:** Enterprise engineering, CTO dashboards, compliance intelligence.

**Business Model:** SaaS subscription | $15–25 per seat per month |Enterprise pricing for \>100 seats | Add-on: AI agent credits for heavy usage.

## **8\. Why Us**

We have lived this problem deeply over our careers.
